Introduction


Tobii Pro Studio has a new format to export eye tracking data.

For each participant, it exports an AOI file listing ALL the defined AOIs 
from ALL the media or stimuli pages as columns, and ALL the timestamps as rows.

For time periods during which media pages are not recorded, ALL the values are empty.
For time periods during which media pages are recorded, at each timestamp, the values
are "1" if there is a fixation on an AOI and "0" otherwise.

Thus, the useful information (i.e., "1"s) is only a tiny part of the AOI file;
the majority are blank with a lot of '0's.

As a comparison, in the early versions of Tobii Studio (at least prior to version 2.1),
the AOI file may contain as few as 3 columns: timestamp, AoiName, and StimuliName.
Every timestamp corresponds to an AOI and a stimuli name.

As a result, for the same recordings, the size of the AOI files from Tobii Pro Studio
could be dozens or hundreds larger than those from early Tobii Studio, depending on
the number of AOIs defined.

The time difference to export files is similar to that of the sizes. Recently, it took 
an i7-quad-core PC three days to export all the AOIs data (59 participants, average 
recording time 15 minutes). Early version of Tobii Studio usually took about one hour
or less to export AOI files for the same recordings.

Therefore, the two R code files is for one AOI file one media page and for multiple
AOI files multiple media pages, respectively.
